## 3D Blockchain work-shop
- In this three-day work shop we were able to dive into the world of blockchain , and its intricacies. and after which we built an ERC-20 token.
- We used the foundry tool to build and test the token, and also used for the deployement to the test-network.

## Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
